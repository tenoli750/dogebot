## üéØ The MECE Framework

At the heart of SentientResearchAgent lies the **MECE principle** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), which provides a universal framework for decomposing ANY task into three fundamental operations.

### What is MECE?

MECE is a problem-solving principle that ensures complete coverage without overlap:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each operation type is distinct‚Äîthere's no ambiguity about whether something is a THINK, WRITE, or SEARCH operation
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: These three operations cover ALL possible tasks‚Äîthere's nothing you need to do that doesn't fit into one of these categories

### The Three Universal Operations

#### ü§î THINK - Reasoning & Analysis
Any cognitive operation that processes information without creating new content or retrieving external data:
- **Data Analysis**: Finding patterns, trends, insights
- **Decision Making**: Choosing between options, evaluating trade-offs
- **Planning**: Breaking down problems, creating strategies
- **Evaluation**: Assessing quality, checking correctness
- **Problem Solving**: Finding solutions, debugging issues

#### ‚úçÔ∏è WRITE - Content Generation & Synthesis
Any operation that creates new content or synthesizes existing information:
- **Document Creation**: Reports, articles, documentation
- **Code Generation**: Writing programs, scripts, configurations
- **Creative Content**: Stories, scripts, marketing copy
- **Synthesis**: Combining multiple sources into cohesive output
- **Formatting**: Structuring and presenting information

#### üîç SEARCH - Information Retrieval
Any operation that gathers information from external sources:
- **Web Research**: Finding online information
- **Database Queries**: Retrieving structured data
- **API Calls**: Fetching from external services
- **Literature Review**: Academic or technical research
- **Data Collection**: Gathering raw information

### Why MECE Matters

1. **Universal Applicability**: ANY task can be broken down into these three operations
2. **Clear Boundaries**: No confusion about which operation to use
3. **Complete Coverage**: Nothing falls through the cracks
4. **Scalable Complexity**: Simple tasks use few operations, complex tasks use many

### MECE in Action

Consider building a market analysis report:

```
Goal: "Create a comprehensive market analysis for electric vehicles"

Decomposition:
1. SEARCH: Gather market data and statistics
2. SEARCH: Find competitor information
3. SEARCH: Collect regulatory information
4. THINK: Analyze market trends
5. THINK: Identify opportunities and threats
6. WRITE: Create executive summary
7. WRITE: Detailed analysis sections
8. THINK: Review and ensure coherence
9. WRITE: Final report with recommendations
```

Each operation is clearly one type, and together they completely achieve the goal.

## üîÑ Execution Flow Architecture

SentientResearchAgent uses a sophisticated three-directional execution flow that mirrors natural problem-solving:

### 1. **Top-Down Decomposition** ‚¨áÔ∏è
Tasks flow from general to specific:
```
"Build a mobile app" (General)
    ‚Üì
"Design UI" + "Build Backend" + "Write Tests" (Specific)
    ‚Üì
"Create login screen" + "Design dashboard" + ... (More Specific)
```

### 2. **Bottom-Up Aggregation** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Results flow from specific to general:
```
Individual UI screens (Specific)
    ‚Üë
Complete UI design (Less Specific)
    ‚Üë
Fully functional app (General)
```

### 3. **Left-to-Right Dependencies** ‚û°Ô∏è
Tasks can depend on siblings for context:
```
"Research users" ‚Üí "Design features" ‚Üí "Build MVP"
     (First)           (Uses research)    (Uses both)
```


### The Recursive Process

1. **Every task starts at an ATOMIZER**
   - Evaluates task complexity
   - Decides: Can this be executed directly (EXECUTE) or needs planning (PLAN)?

2. **If EXECUTE node**:
   - Task is atomic (can't be broken down further)
   - Appropriate executor agent is called
   - Result is returned

3. **If PLAN node**:
   - Task is complex and needs decomposition
   - Planner agent breaks it into subtasks (THINK, WRITE, or SEARCH)
   - Each subtask goes through its own atomizer
   - Process repeats recursively to any depth

4. **Horizontal Dependencies** (Optional):
   - Tasks can depend on siblings at the same level
   - Dependent tasks wait for predecessors to complete
   - Results flow left-to-right when dependencies exist
   - Independent tasks execute in parallel

5. **AGGREGATOR collects results**:
   - Once all subtasks complete
   - Combines results intelligently based on context
   - Returns synthesized result to parent
   - Parent may itself be a subtask in a larger tree

## üéöÔ∏è Recursive Depth Control

One of SentientResearchAgent's most powerful features is **customizable recursion depth**, allowing you to control the granularity of task decomposition.

*Note: at the moment, we have found most use-cases work well for depths **<= 3***


### Controlling Depth

```python
# Shallow depth for quick tasks
agent = SentientAgent.create(max_depth=2)
quick_result = await agent.run("Summarize this article")

# Deep depth for comprehensive analysis
agent = SentientAgent.create(max_depth=5)
detailed_result = await agent.run("Create a complete business plan")

# Automatic depth (recommended)
agent = SentientAgent.create()  # System determines optimal depth
result = await agent.run("Your task here")
```

### Depth Guidelines

| Task Complexity | Recommended Depth | Use Cases |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Simple | 1 | Summaries, quick searches, basic writing |
| Moderate | 2-3 | Blog posts, reports, standard analysis |
| Complex | 3-4 | in-depth reports, comprehensive story generation |

## üîç Stage Tracing & Transparency

**Stage Tracing** is what sets SentientResearchAgent apart‚Äîcomplete visibility into every step of the execution process.

### What is Stage Tracing?

Stage Tracing provides a detailed log of:
- **Inputs**: Exactly what each agent receives
- **Processing**: How the agent interprets and processes the input
- **Outputs**: What the agent produces
- **Context**: The surrounding information used
- **Decisions**: Why certain choices were made

### Benefits of Stage Tracing

1. **Debugging Made Easy**
   - See exactly where issues occur
   - Understand why certain outputs were produced
   - Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies

2. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Find redundant operations
   - Identify slow stages
   - Optimize prompts and workflows

3. **Trust Through Transparency**
   - No "black box" mystery
   - Understand the reasoning process
   - Verify correctness at each step

4. **Rapid Iteration**
   - See immediate effects of changes
   - Test different approaches quickly
   - Build confidence in your agents


## üå≥ Hierarchical Task Decomposition

The core principle of SentientResearchAgent is **hierarchical task decomposition** through a recursive atomizer-planner-executor architecture.

### The Concept

The framework mirrors human problem-solving through a recursive process:
1. **Atomizer evaluates** - Is this task atomic or does it need planning?
2. **If atomic** - Execute directly with appropriate agent
3. **If complex** - Plan and decompose into subtasks (THINK, WRITE, SEARCH)
4. **Recursively process** - Each subtask goes through the same evaluation
5. **Aggregate results** - Combine outputs bottom-up through aggregators

### Visual Example with Atomizer Flow

```

```

### Key Components in Action

1. **ATOMIZER** - The gatekeeper that decides task handling:
   - Evaluates complexity
   - Routes to PLAN or EXECUTE
   - Ensures appropriate decomposition depth

2. **PLAN NODE** - The decomposer:
   - Breaks complex tasks into MECE subtasks
   - Assigns task types (THINK, WRITE, SEARCH)
   - Defines dependencies

3. **EXECUTE NODE** - The worker:
   - Handles atomic tasks
   - Uses specialized agents
   - Returns concrete results

4. **AGGREGATOR** - The synthesizer:
   - Collects all subtask results
   - Combines intelligently based on context
   - Returns unified output to parent

### Benefits

- **Intelligent Decomposition**: Atomizer ensures optimal task breakdown
- **Parallelization**: Independent subtasks run concurrently
- **Specialization**: Right agent for each task type
- **Clarity**: Complex goals become traceable execution paths
- **Flexibility**: Recursive depth adapts to task complexity

## üì¶ Task Nodes

A **TaskNode** is the fundamental unit of work in the system.

### Structure

```python
class TaskNode:
    # Identity
    task_id: str              # Unique identifier (e.g., "root.1.2")
    goal: str                 # What this node should accomplish
    
    # Classification
    task_type: TaskType       # SEARCH, WRITE, or THINK
    node_type: NodeType       # PLAN or EXECUTE
    
    # Hierarchy
    layer: int                # Depth in the task tree (0 = root)
    parent_node_id: str       # Parent task reference
    sub_graph_id: str         # Reference to subtask graph (PLAN nodes)
    
    # State
    status: TaskStatus        # Current execution state
    result: Any               # Task output
    error: str                # Error message if failed
    
    # Metadata
    timestamp_created: datetime
    timestamp_completed: datetime
    agent_name: str           # Which agent processed this
```

### Example TaskNode

```json
{
  "task_id": "root.1",
  "goal": "Research renewable energy trends in 2024",
  "task_type": "SEARCH",

## ü§ñ Agent System

Agents are the workers that process tasks. Each agent specializes in specific operations.

### Agent Roles

#### 1. Atomizer Agents

**Purpose**: Determine if a task needs decomposition

```python
Input: "Write a blog post about AI"
Output: {
  "is_atomic": False,  # Too complex, needs planning
  "refined_goal": "Write comprehensive blog post about AI developments"
}
```

#### 2. Planner Agents

**Purpose**: Decompose complex tasks

```python
Input: "Research and compare cloud providers"
Output: {
  "subtasks": [
    {"goal": "Research AWS features and pricing", "type": "SEARCH"},
    {"goal": "Research Azure features and pricing", "type": "SEARCH"},
    {"goal": "Research GCP features and pricing", "type": "SEARCH"},
    {"goal": "Create comparison matrix", "type": "THINK"},
    {"goal": "Write recommendation report", "type": "WRITE"}
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Executor Agents

**Purpose**: Perform actual work

```python
Input: "Search for quantum computing applications"
Output: {
  "result": "Found 5 key applications: cryptography, drug discovery...",
  "sources": ["Nature 2024", "MIT Research"],
  "confidence": 0.88
}
```

#### 4. Aggregator Agents

**Purpose**: Combine results from subtasks

```python
Input: [result1, result2, result3]
Output: {
  "summary": "Comprehensive analysis shows...",
  "key_findings": ["Finding 1", "Finding 2"],
  "conclusion": "Based on all research..."
}
```

## üîó Context Propagation

Context ensures information flows intelligently between tasks.

### Context Types

#### 1. Lineage Context
Information from parent and ancestor tasks:
```python
{
  "overall_objective": "Write investment report",
  "parent_goal": "Analyze tech stocks",
  "constraints": ["Focus on 2024 data", "Include ESG factors"]
}
```

#### 2. Sibling Context
Results from completed sibling tasks:
```python
{
  "sibling_results": [
    {"task": "Research Company A", "result": "..."},
    {"task": "Research Company B", "result": "..."}
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Global Context
System-wide information:
```python
{
  "execution_id": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15",
  "user_preferences": {"style": "formal", "length": "detailed"}
}
```

### Context Flow Example

```
Root Task (context: user request)
    ‚Üì (passes objective)
Plan Node (context: objective + constraints)
    ‚Üì (passes plan context)
Execute Node 1 (context: plan + objective)
    ‚Üí (shares results)
Execute Node 2 (context: plan + objective + Node1 results)
    ‚Üë (aggregates all)
Aggregator (context: all child results + original objective)
```

## üíæ Knowledge Store

The Knowledge Store maintains execution state and enables context sharing.

### Key Functions

#### 1. Result Storage
```python
knowledge_store.store_node_result(
    node_id="root.1",
    result={"content": "Analysis complete...", "score": 0.95}
)
```

#### 2. Context Retrieval
```python
# Get results from same level
sibling_results = knowledge_store.get_sibling_results("root.2")

# Get parent context
parent_context = knowledge_store.get_parent_context("root.2.1")

# Get all relevant context
context = knowledge_store.get_relevant_results_for_node(node)
```

#### 3. Lineage Tracking
```python
# Get complete execution path
lineage = knowledge_store.get_node_lineage("root.1.2.3")
# Returns: ["root", "root.1", "root.1.2", "root.1.2.3"]
```

### Storage Optimization

- **In-memory caching** for fast access
- **Selective persistence** for important results
- **Context summarization** to manage size
- **TTL-based cleanup** for old data

## ‚ö° Execution Strategies

### 1. Parallel Execution

Independent tasks run simultaneously:

```
        [Task A] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
Root ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Task B] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Aggregator
        [Task C] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
execution:
  max_concurrent_nodes: 10
  enable_immediate_slot_fill: true
```

### 2. Sequential Execution

Tasks with dependencies run in order:

```
Root ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Task A] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Task B] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Task C] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Result
```

**Use Case**: When each task depends on the previous one

### 3. Mixed Strategy

Combination of parallel and sequential:

```
        ‚îå‚îÄ‚Üí [Research A] ‚îÄ‚îê
Root ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí‚îÇ                 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Analysis] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Report]
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí [Research B] ‚îÄ‚îò
```

## üéØ Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work in practice:

1. **User submits goal** ‚Üí Creates root TaskNode
2. **Atomizer checks complexity** ‚Üí Determines PLAN vs EXECUTE
3. **Planner decomposes** ‚Üí Creates subtask graph
4. **Scheduler activates tasks** ‚Üí Based on dependencies
5. **Executors process** ‚Üí Using specialized agents
6. **Context flows** ‚Üí Between related tasks
7. **Results aggregate** ‚Üí Bottom-up synthesis
8. **HITL intervenes** ‚Üí At configured checkpoints
9. **Final result emerges** ‚Üí From hierarchical processing

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Task Granularity
- Not too broad: "Solve world hunger" ‚ùå
- Not too narrow: "Type the letter A" ‚ùå
- Just right: "Research food security initiatives in Africa" ‚úÖ

### 2. Agent Selection
- Match agents to task types
- Use specialized agents for better results
- Create custom agents for domain-specific needs

### 3. Context Management
- Keep context focused and relevant
- Summarize when passing between layers
- Preserve critical information

### 4. Error Handling
- Plan for failure at each level
- Implement retry strategies
- Provide meaningful error messages
